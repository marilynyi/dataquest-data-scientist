    "### Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    ">Many people start playing the lottery for fun, but for some this activity turns into a habit which eventually escalates into addiction. Like other compulsive gamblers, lottery addicts soon begin spending from their savings and loans, accumulate debts, and eventually engage in desperate behaviors like theft.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">A medical institute that aims to prevent and treat gambling addictions wants to build a dedicated mobile app to help lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning. The institute has a team of engineers that will build the app, but they need us to create the logical core of the app and calculate probabilities.\n",

    "### Goal\n",
    "\n",
    ">For the first version of the app, they want us to focus on the [6/49 lottery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotto_6/49) and build functions that enable users to answer questions like:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">- What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    ">- What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?\n",
    ">- What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The institute also wants us to consider historical data coming from the national 6/49 lottery game in Canada. The [data set from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datascienceai/lottery-dataset) has data for 3,665 drawings, dating from 1982 to 2018.\n",

    "### Result\n",
    "\n",
    "The 6/49 Lottery has a fixed jackpot amount of \\\\$5 million with six matching numbers. Because the 6/49 is a Canadian lottery, the winnings are non-taxable so the winner takes home the full amount. Each ticket costs \\\\$3. The odds of winning jackpot is 1 in 13,983,816 or 0.0000071511%. Using historical winning numbers neither improves nor worsens the odds; the same with using Quick Pick versus manually choosing numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The odds of winning drastically improves to 1 in 13 if one purchases one million tickets which equates to a cost of \\\\$3 million and net profit of \\\\$2 million assuming one sole winner. Compare this to a more reasonable purchase amount of 40 tickets which costs \\\\$120 and decreases the odds of winning to 1 in 349,595. Based on individual risk threshold and disposable income level, one can \"game\" the system by purchasing more tickets to increase the odds. There is also the risk of sharing the prize with other potential winners which may remove net profit altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prizes are also available if 2, 3, 4, or 5 numbers match the winning numbers. The odds of matching the winning numbers are listed below.\n",
